# chatterbox


## Overview

chatterbox is a communication platform inspired by preexisting platforms such as Discord, Facebook, and Twitter. However of the three, it is more inspired by Discord since it
proposes many intricacies such as creating a server with your friends. This is the modern take on a group chat. We want to say Discord is the child of mirc and ventrilo
and chatterbox hopes to be the child of Discord, Facebook, Twitter.

## Getting Started

First off, clone the repository onto your local machine.

cd into the project's client directory.

Since node modules are part of .gitignore, you would be to run "npm i" in the project directory to build all the dependencies.

Run "npm start" in the current directory to bring up the localhost server. It should be on port 3000.

## Requirements

(___TODO__: List out any technologies needed to run your project_)

Node 14.15.1

NPM 6.14.8

Python 3.8.5

Flask 1.1.2
